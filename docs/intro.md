# Welcome

Welcome to the Barklarm user guide! This guide shows you how to get started on observing your projects better.

## What is Barklarm?

Barklarm is a cross-platform app created using electron that allows you to add notifications to your computer to understand better the real-time behavior of your system. You can observe your CI/CD deployments, alarms, metrics, etc.

## Is Barklarm for me?

If you are running production services and want to be able to react as soon as possible to issues without the mental bandwidth of checking different places manually, I would say yes!

## Ready to get started?

Find out how to define and use your observers in [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start). Or visit the [page](https://www.barklarm.com/) and [its repo](https://github.com/kanekotic/barklarm) and start exploring.
