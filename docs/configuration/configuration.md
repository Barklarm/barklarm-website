# Configuration

The configuration window can be open from the tray menu by clicking on the configure section of the menu.

![Configure window](./img/configure_window.jpeg)

As seen on the previous image, it's composed of the next sections:

* List of project configurations: These are the individual projects that can be configured in the application.
* Add Button: allows adding a new configuration section
* Save button: allows persisting the current configuration. This is important as nothing will be configured until this button is press.
