      <p>
        I have been working in the industry for many years now and always got to use cctray for build radiation. <br/>
        Nevertheless i always felt something was missing, and was to centralize alarms not only from our builds but also other systems.<br />
        Hope Barklarm can help to fill that space, any feedback will be Welcome.
